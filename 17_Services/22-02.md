 Kubernetes Services Explained - ClusterIP vs NodePort vs Loadbalancer vs External ☸️


### Pre-requisite for Kind cluster
If you use a Kind cluster, you must perform the port mapping to expose the container port. Use the below config to create a new Kind cluster

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30001
    hostPort: 30001
- role: worker
- role: worker
```
###command to create new cluster 

``` kind create cluster --config kind.yaml --name cka-cluster```

### What is Service in Kubernetes

Different applications communicate with each other within Kubernetes using a service; it is also used to access applications outside the cluster.

There are 4 types of Services:
- ClusterIP(For Internal access)
- NodePort(To access the application on a particular port)
- LoadBalancer(To access the application on a domain name or IP address without using the port number)
- External (To use an external DNS for routing)

### ClusterIP

#### Sample YAML for ClusterIP

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cluster-svc
  labels:
    env: demo
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    env: demo
```


### NodePort

#### Sample YAML for Nodeport

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodeport-svc
  labels:
    env: demo
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30001
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    env: demo
```


### LoadBalancer
- Your loadbalancer service will act as nodeport if you are not using any managed cloud Kubernetes such as GKE,AKS,EKS etc. In a managed cloud environment, Kubernetes creates a load balancer within the cloud project, which redirects the traffic to the Kubernetes Loadbalancer service.

#### Sample YAML for Loadbalancer

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: lb-svc
  labels:
    env: demo
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    env: demo
```

#### Sample YAML for external name

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: prod
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my.api.example.com
```


In this exercise, you will create a Deployment and expose a container port for its Pods. You will demonstrate the differences between the service types ClusterIP and NodePort.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can create a local Kubernetes cluster by following [Day06 Video](https://youtu.be/RORhczcOrWs)
> Also, do the node binding at the cluster level if you are using KIND. The Day9 video has the details on how to do that.

### Task details
1. Create a Service named `myapp` of type `ClusterIP` that exposes port 80 and maps to the target port 80.
2. Create a Deployment named `myapp` that creates 1 replica running the image `nginx:1.23.4-alpine`. Expose the container port 80.
3. Scale the Deployment to 2 replicas.
4. Create a temporary Pod using the image `busybox` and run a `wget` command against the IP of the service.
5. Run a `wget` command against the service outside the cluster.
6. Change the service type so the Pods can be reached outside the cluster.
7. Run a `wget` command against the service outside the cluster.
8. Discuss: Can you expose the Pods as a service without a deployment?
9. Discuss: Under what condition would you use the service types `LoadBalancer,` `node port,` `clusterIP,` and `external`?
